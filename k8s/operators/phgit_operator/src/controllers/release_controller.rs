 * This file contains the reconciliation logic for the `PhgitRelease` custom
 * resource. It acts as a high-level orchestrator for progressive delivery
 * strategies like Canary and Blue-Green deployments.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - The reconciler reads the `strategy` defined in the `PhgitRelease` spec.
 * - Based on the strategy type, it manipulates other Kubernetes resources,
 * such as Deployments, Services, and potentially CRs from a service mesh
 * (e.g., Istio's VirtualService).
 * - The goal is to translate the user's high-level intent (e.g., "canary 10%
 * of traffic to v1.2.0") into the concrete, low-level resource configurations
 * required to achieve it.
 * - The controller will manage a state machine for the release process, updating
 * the `.status` field with the current phase (e.g., Progressing, Succeeded,
 * Failed) and details like the active versions and traffic split.
 * - This file provides the structural skeleton for this complex logic, with
 * placeholders for the detailed interactions with Kubernetes objects.
