# This file defines the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the phRelease
# resource. This CRD provides a high-level, declarative API for managing
# complex release strategies like Canary and Blue-Green deployments.
#
# Architecture:
# - It establishes the 'phRelease' kind within the 'ph.io' API group.
# - The `spec` is designed to be abstract and user-friendly. A user specifies
#   *what* they want (e.g., a Canary release of version 1.2.0 with 10% traffic)
#   without needing to know the low-level details of manipulating Istio
#   VirtualServices or other service mesh resources.
# - The ph Operator will translate this high-level intent into the necessary
#   low-level Kubernetes resource manipulations.
# - The `status` field provides a detailed, real-time view of the release's
#   progress, including which versions are active, the current traffic split,
#   and any conditions or errors encountered during the rollout.
# - This CRD forms the core of the Release Orchestrator functionality.
