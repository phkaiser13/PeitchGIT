# Workflow triggers:
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Runs on pushes to the main branch
    tags:
      - 'v*'          # Runs when a tag like v1.0.0 is created
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Runs on pull requests to the main branch

jobs:
  # Main build job that compiles and verifies the project
  build:
    name: Build and Test (Arch Linux)
    # WARNING: GitHub does not provide Arch Linux runners.
    # You must set up a self-hosted runner with Arch Linux.

    steps:
