# gitph User Guide

## 1\. Introduction

Welcome to `gitph`\!

`gitph` is not just another Git wrapper; it's a powerful, polyglot command-line assistant designed to supercharge your development and DevOps workflows. Whether you prefer a straightforward command-line interface (CLI) for scripting and automation or a guided, menu-driven text-based UI (TUI) for interactive sessions, `gitph` has you covered.

The core philosophy behind `gitph` is leveraging the best tool for the job. It combines the raw performance and low-level control of **C** and **Rust**, the powerful concurrency of **Go** for network tasks, and a flexible **Lua** scripting engine for user-level customization.

This guide will walk you through everything from installation to advanced usage and customization.

## 2\. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

Before building `gitph` from source, you need to ensure you have the necessary development toolchains installed. The project provides a helper script to check for these dependencies.

**Required Dependencies:**

  * A C/C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang)
  * CMake (version 3.15 or higher)
  * Go (version 1.18 or higher)
  * The Rust toolchain (rustc and cargo)
  * Lua 5.4 development headers (`liblua5.4-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
  * libcurl development headers (`libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)

On Debian-based Linux systems, you can install most of these with a single command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config liblua5.4-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev nlohmann-json3-dev
```

*Note: This command is taken from the CI workflow and is a reliable way to get the core C/C++ dependencies.*

For other systems (Fedora, Arch, macOS), a setup script is available at `scripts/setup_dev_env.sh` which will attempt to use your native package manager to install these dependencies.

### 2.2. Building the Project

`gitph` uses CMake to orchestrate its complex multi-language build process, with a convenient `Makefile` for simpler commands.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phkaiser13/peitchgit.git
    cd peitchgit
    ```

2.  **Build the application:**
    The easiest way to build is by using the provided `Makefile`:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This command will automatically run CMake to configure the project and then build all components in parallel.

Alternatively, you can use the build scripts directly:

  * On Linux/macOS: `./scripts/build.sh`
  * On Windows: `.\scripts\build.bat`

After a successful build, you will find the main executable at `build/bin/gitph` and all the functional modules as shared libraries (`.so` or `.dll`) in `build/bin/modules/`.

### 2.3. Configuration

`gitph` can be configured using a simple `key=value` file named `gitph.conf` located in the same directory as the executable. The application will load this file on startup.

The configuration manager ignores empty lines and lines starting with a `#` symbol.

**Example `gitph.conf`:**

```
# This is a comment
default_remote=origin
default_branch=develop
```

Modules can access these values to modify their behavior. For instance, the `git_ops` module could be extended to use `default_remote` and `default_branch` for the `SND` command.

## 3\. Core Concepts

### 3.1. Dual Interface: TUI and CLI

`gitph` is designed for two primary modes of operation.

**Interactive Mode (TUI):**
If you run `gitph` without any arguments, it will launch a Text-based User Interface. This mode is perfect for new users or for exploring the available features. The TUI dynamically generates a menu of all available commands by querying the loaded modules, ensuring the menu is always up-to-date with the installed plugins.

**Command-Line Mode (CLI):**
You can also call `gitph` directly with commands and arguments, making it ideal for scripting and automation.

```bash
./build/bin/gitph status
```

The CLI dispatcher is the central router for all non-interactive commands. It finds the appropriate module to handle the command and executes it.

### 3.2. The Polyglot Module System

The power of `gitph` comes from its modules. The C core application is intentionally lightweight; all the major features are implemented in self-contained modules written in Rust, Go, or C++. These modules are loaded dynamically at runtime from the `modules/` directory. This means you can add or update features simply by adding or replacing a module file, without recompiling the core application.

## 4\. Module Command Reference

This section provides a detailed guide to the commands offered by each core module.

### 4.1. `git_ops` (Rust)

This module provides fundamental Git operations by wrapping the `git` command-line tool. The logic is implemented to be robust and provide clear feedback.

  * **`status`**

      * **Description:** Shows a concise, machine-readable view of the current repository status. It uses `git status --porcelain` internally for a clean output.
      * **Usage:** `gitph status`
      * **Output:** If there are changes, it will print the modified files. If the working tree is clean, it will print a "Working tree clean" message.

  * **`SND`**

      * **Description:** A powerful high-level "Send" command that automates a common workflow. It automatically:
        1.  Stages all current changes (`git add .`).
        2.  Commits them with a default message ("Automated commit from gitph").
        3.  Pushes the commit to the default remote and branch (`git push origin main`).
      * **Usage:** `gitph SND`
      * **Note:** This is an opinionated command designed for speed. It will intelligently handle cases where there is nothing to commit.

### 4.2. `api_client` (Go)

A client module for interacting with Git provider APIs, such as GitHub. It is built using Go for its excellent networking and JSON handling capabilities.

  * **`srp <user/repo>`**
      * **Description:** "Set RePository". This command fetches and displays public metadata about a GitHub repository, including stars, forks, description, and the default branch.
      * **Usage:** `gitph srp phkaiser13/peitchgit`
      * **Output:** A formatted table displaying the fetched repository information.

### 4.3. `issue_tracker` (Rust)

An asynchronous client for interacting with issue tracking services like GitHub Issues. It uses Rust's `tokio` runtime to perform network requests without blocking the main application, ensuring the UI remains responsive.

  * **`issue-get <user/repo> <issue_id>`**
      * **Description:** Fetches and displays the details for a specific issue from a GitHub repository.
      * **Usage:** `gitph issue-get rust-lang/rust 50000`
      * **Output:** A clean, formatted summary of the issue including its ID, title, author, state, and URL.

### 4.4. `devops_automation` (Go)

A wrapper for common DevOps command-line tools like Terraform and Vault, designed to streamline Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and secret management workflows.

  * **`tf-plan`**

      * **Description:** Executes `terraform plan` and streams the output directly to your console in real-time. This is ideal for interactive review of planned infrastructure changes.
      * **Usage:** `gitph tf-plan`

  * **`tf-apply`**

      * **Description:** Executes `terraform apply` for interactive IaC workflows, again with real-time streaming output.
      * **Usage:** `gitph tf-apply`

  * **`vault-read <secret_path>`**

      * **Description:** Reads a secret from HashiCorp Vault. It captures the JSON output, parses it, and displays the secret's key-value pairs in a readable format.
      * **Usage:** `gitph vault-read secret/data/app/config`
      * **Output:** A list of the key-value data stored at that secret path.

### 4.5. `sync_engine` (Rust)

This is one of `gitph`'s most advanced features. It's a sophisticated, stateful engine for performing bi-directional repository synchronization. Unlike simple `git pull/push` wrappers, it uses the `git2-rs` library to directly manipulate the Git object database for complex commit graph analysis.

  * **`sync-run <path_to_source_repo> <path_to_target_repo>`**
      * **Description:** Initiates the synchronization process between two local repositories.
      * **Stateful Operation:** The engine is stateful. After the first successful sync, it creates a file at `.git/gitph_sync_state.json` inside the source repository to remember the last common commit. This allows for more intelligent syncs in the future.
      * **Divergence Detection:** The engine's primary safety feature is its ability to detect "divergence"â€”a situation where both repositories have unique commits since the last sync. If divergence is detected, the engine will safely abort and require manual intervention to prevent accidental data loss.
      * **Usage:** `gitph sync-run ./my-repo-fork ./official-repo`

### 4.6. `ci_cd_manager` (Go/C++)

This is a two-part module for visualizing CI/CD workflows. While its direct user-facing command may evolve, its internal mechanism is a showcase of polyglot architecture.

  * **Functionality:** A Go component parses a workflow YAML file (like a GitHub Actions `.yml` file) and serializes it to a language-agnostic JSON string. This JSON is then passed to a C++ component that parses the JSON and prints a formatted, human-readable representation of the pipeline to the console.

## 5\. Extending `gitph` with Lua Plugins

One of the most powerful features of `gitph` is its extensibility. You can add your own custom functionality by placing simple Lua scripts (`.lua` files) into the `src/plugins/` directory. The C core will automatically load and execute these scripts at startup.

A global table named `gitph` is exposed to the Lua environment, providing access to core functionalities.

### 5.1. Lua API Functions

  * `gitph.log(level, message)`

      * **Description:** Allows your plugin to write to the main `gitph` log file (`gitph_log.txt`). The `level` should be a string: "INFO", "DEBUG", "WARN", or "ERROR".
      * **Example:** `gitph.log("INFO", "My custom plugin has loaded.")`

  * `gitph.register_alias(alias, command)`

      * **Description:** This is the key to creating your own shortcuts. It registers a new `alias` that, when run, will execute the target `command`.
      * **Example:** The included `custom_aliases.lua` plugin demonstrates this perfectly:
        ```lua
        -- Allows you to run 'gitph st' instead of 'gitph status'
        gitph.register_alias("st", "status")

        -- Allows you to run 'gitph snd' instead of 'gitph SND'
        gitph.register_alias("snd", "SND")
        ```

### 5.2. Event Hooks

You can define special global functions in your Lua scripts that the `gitph` core will automatically call at specific points in its lifecycle. This enables you to enforce policies or automate actions.

  * `on_pre_push(remote, branch)`
      * **Description:** If you define a global function with this exact name, it will be executed by the core just before a push operation. You can perform checks and, crucially, **return `false` to cancel the push**.
      * **Example:** The included `pre_push_hook.lua` plugin provides an excellent example of policy enforcement. It prevents direct pushes to the `main` branch:
        ```lua
        function on_pre_push(remote, branch)
            gitph.log("INFO", "Executing pre-push hook...")

            -- Policy: Prevent direct pushes to the 'main' branch.
            if branch == "main" then
                gitph.log("ERROR", "Direct push to 'main' branch is forbidden.")
                print("[POLICY VIOLATION] You cannot push directly to the main branch.")
                return false -- This cancels the push operation.
            end

            -- If all checks pass, allow the push.
            return true
        end
        ```
