## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Integrated Git Interface**: Visualize your repository history, manage branches, tags, remotes, and worktrees from a dedicated and intuitive sidebar view.
  * **Effortless Staging & Committing**: A dedicated panel for viewing diffs, staging/unstaging files with a single click, and crafting the perfect commit without command-line guesswork.
  * **Zero-Checkout Branch Inspection**: Instantly browse the complete file tree of any branch without performing a `checkout`, saving you time and context-switching.
  * **ü§ñ AI-Powered Release Management**: Automate your release process. Generate detailed changelogs from your commit history using AI, create annotated tags, and push releases with a single command.
  * **Advanced Workflow Tools**: Seamlessly manage Git worktrees, push to multiple mirror remotes simultaneously, and access the full suite of `phgit` commands directly from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

-----

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1.  Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2.  Go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3.  Search for "**Peitch Git**".
4.  Click **Install**.

Once installed, the Peitch Git icon will appear in your Activity Bar.

-----

## üíª UI Showcase

### 1\. The Peitch Sidebar

Click the Peitch icon in the Activity Bar to get a complete overview of your repository. From here, you can navigate your branches, remotes, tags, and worktrees. Clicking any item will open a detailed view in the main panel.

### 2\. Commits & Staging Panel

When you open the main panel, the **Overview** tab shows your current branch status. Switch to the **Commits & Staging** tab to see all modified files.

  * Use the `+` icon to **stage** a file.
  * Use the `-` icon to **unstage** it.
  * Write your commit message and click **Commit** to finalize.

### 3\. The Branch Inspector

In the sidebar, simply click on any branch name. The main panel will switch to the **Branch View**, showing the entire file tree for that branch. You can open and view files as if you had checked out the branch, which is perfect for quick reviews and comparisons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features & Commands

Access powerful workflows directly from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

  * **`Peitch: Create Release with AI`**: Kicks off the automated release process. It analyzes commits between two refs (e.g., tags or branches), generates a changelog, creates a new annotated tag, and pushes it.
  * **`Peitch: Push to All Remotes`**: Pushes your current branch to all repositories configured in your `peitch.mirrors` setting. Ideal for keeping forks and backups synchronized.
  * **`Peitch: Manage Worktrees`**: A UI-driven way to create, list, and remove Git worktrees, enabling you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing changes.
  * **`Peitch: Add Remote`**: Quickly add a new remote repository.

-----
