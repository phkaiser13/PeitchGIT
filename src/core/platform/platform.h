 * platform.h - Platform Abstraction Layer Interface.
 *
 * This header defines a consistent interface for interacting with
 * operating system-specific functionalities. The goal is to isolate all
 * platform-dependent code within the `platform_win.c` and `platform_posix.c`
 * implementation files, allowing the rest of the core application to be
 * written in a portable, OS-agnostic manner.
 *
 * Functions declared here handle tasks such as:
 * - Initializing the console for proper rendering (e.g., enabling ANSI
 *   escape codes on Windows).
 * - Clearing the terminal screen.
 * - Retrieving environment-specific paths (e.g., user's home directory).
 * - Abstracting file system path separators.
 * - Providing the correct file extension for shared libraries (.dll vs .so).
