/*
 * This header is intentionally left sparse.
 * The main() function is the C standard entry point and does not require a
 * prototype declaration to be called by the C runtime startup code.
 *
 * All logic is orchestrated from within main.c, which includes the necessary
 * headers from other modules to delegate tasks.
