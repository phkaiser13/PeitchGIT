/**
 * @brief A safe string duplication function.
 *
 * This function behaves like the standard `strdup`, but with a critical
 * safety feature: it checks the return value of `malloc`. If memory allocation
 * fails, it prints a fatal error message to stderr and terminates the program.
 * This prevents the application from continuing in an unstable state.
 *
 * @param s The null-terminated string to duplicate.
 * @return A pointer to a newly allocated string.
 * @note The caller is responsible for freeing the returned pointer using `free()`.

/**
 * @brief Joins two path components using the correct platform-specific separator.
 *
 * This utility handles path joining intelligently, ensuring that exactly one
 * path separator exists between the two components, regardless of whether the
 * input components have trailing or leading separators.
 *
 * @param base The base path component (e.g., "/home/user/docs").
 * @param leaf The leaf path component (e.g., "file.txt").
 * @return A pointer to a newly allocated string containing the joined path.
 *         Returns NULL if memory allocation fails.
 * @note The caller is responsible for freeing the returned pointer using `free()`.

/**
 * @brief Reads the entire content of a file into a dynamically allocated string.
 *
 * This function opens, reads, and closes the specified file, returning its
 * entire content in a single buffer. The buffer is always null-terminated,
 * making it safe to use as a C string.
 *
 * @param filepath The path to the file to be read.
 * @param[out] file_size A pointer to a size_t variable where the size of the
 *                       file (in bytes, excluding the null terminator) will be
 *                       stored. Can be NULL if the size is not needed.
 * @return A pointer to a newly allocated buffer containing the file's content,
 *         or NULL if the file cannot be opened, read, or if memory allocation
 *         fails.
 * @note The caller is responsible for freeing the returned pointer using `free()`.
