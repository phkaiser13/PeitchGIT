 *
 * This file is responsible for all Git and GitHub operations required to reconcile
 * configuration drift. Its primary function, `create_reconciliation_pr`, takes the
 * detected drift details, programmatically creates a new Git branch, applies the
 * correct configurations to files in the local repository clone, commits, pushes to the
 * remote, and then opens a pull request on GitHub.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The implementation is carefully designed to be robust, secure, and non-blocking.
 * 1. Git Operations (`git2`): For interacting with the local Git repository, this module
 * uses the `git2` crate, which provides safe Rust bindings to the battle-tested `libgit2`
 * library. This is a superior approach to shelling out to the `git` command-line tool, as
 * it avoids command injection vulnerabilities, provides better error handling, and offers
 * a structured, programmatic API.
 * 2. GitHub API (`octocrab`): For creating the pull request, the `octocrab` crate is
 * utilized. It is a modern, `async`-native GitHub API client that integrates seamlessly
 * with the Tokio runtime, ensuring that network operations do not block execution.
 * 3. Configuration and Security: All sensitive information, such as the GitHub Personal
 * Access Token (PAT), is passed as arguments and not hardcoded. The function requires
 * a PAT with `repo` scope to create branches and pull requests.
 * 4. Asynchronicity and I/O: File system operations (writing the corrected Kubernetes
 * manifests) are performed using `tokio::fs` to maintain the asynchronous nature of the
 * application.
 * 5. Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling is implemented using `anyhow::Result`.
 * Each stepâ€”opening the repo, creating a branch, writing files, committing, pushing, and
 * creating the PRâ€”is equipped with context-rich error reporting to simplify debugging.
 *
 * Process Flow:
 * - A collection of `DriftDetail` structs is received as input.
 * - A unique, timestamped branch name is generated (e.g., "reconciliation/2025-08-25T142015Z").
 * - The local Git repository is opened.
 * - The new branch is created from the HEAD of the default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
 * - The working directory is updated to reflect the new branch.
 * - The corrected Kubernetes YAML configurations (`live_yaml` from `DriftDetail`) are
 * written to their corresponding file paths, overwriting the drifted files.
 * - All changes in the working directory are staged for commit.
 * - A commit is created with a standardized message detailing the automated reconciliation.
 * - The new branch with its commit is pushed to the remote repository (`origin`).
 * - Using the GitHub API, a pull request is created from the new branch to the default branch.
 * - The URL of the newly created pull request is returned upon success.
 *
 * This modular separation ensures that `git_ops.rs` focuses solely on the "Act" phase of
 * the GitOps loop, leaving detection to `kube_diff.rs`.
