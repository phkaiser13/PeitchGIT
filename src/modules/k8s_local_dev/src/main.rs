 * File: src/modules/k8s_local_dev/src/main.rs
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for the `k8s_local_dev` command-line
 * interface (CLI). Its purpose is to provide developers with a simple, unified
 * tool to provision and manage local Kubernetes development environments using
 * various underlying provisioners like 'kind' (Kubernetes in Docker) and 'k3s'.
 * The entire application is built using the `clap` crate for powerful, declarative
 * argument parsing and the `tokio` runtime for asynchronous execution.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The architecture is designed around `clap`'s derive-based argument parsing, which
 * allows for a highly structured and self-documenting CLI definition. The core
 * principles are:
 * 1. Declarative CLI Structure: Structs and enums are used with `clap` attributes
 * (`#[derive(Parser)]`, `#[command(...)]`, `#[arg(...)]`) to define the entire
 * command hierarchy, including subcommands, arguments, and help messages. This
 * approach is clean, readable, and less error-prone than manual parsing.
 * 2. Asynchronous Execution: The `main` function is marked with `#[tokio::main]`,
 * ensuring that all I/O operations, particularly the execution of external commands
 * (`kind`, `k3s`, etc.), are non-blocking. This is handled by dedicated functions
 * within the `provisioners` module.
 * 3. Modularity: The core logic for each provisioner is encapsulated in its own
 * module (e.g., `src/provisioners/kind.rs`, `src/provisioners/k3s.rs`). The `main.rs`
 * file is responsible only for parsing user input and dispatching the command to the
 * appropriate module, adhering to the single-responsibility principle.
 * 4. Rich User Feedback and Error Handling: The application provides clear feedback
 * to the user about the actions being performed. All fallible operations return
 * `anyhow::Result`, and errors are propagated up to the main function where they
 * are printed in a user-friendly format. This ensures that if an underlying tool
 * (like `kind`) fails, its error output is clearly visible.
 *
 * Process Flow:
 * - The user invokes the binary with a command, e.g., `k8s_local_dev create kind --name my-cluster`.
 * - `clap::Parser::parse()` is called on the `Cli` struct.
 * - `clap` parses the arguments and populates an instance of the `Cli` struct.
 * - A `match` statement on the `Cli.command` enum dispatches control to the handler
 * for the specified subcommand (e.g., `Commands::Create`).
 * - Inside the handler, another `match` statement on the provisioner enum dispatches
 * to the specific function (e.g., `provisioners::kind::create_cluster`).
 * - The provisioner function is called with the arguments provided by the user (e.g., cluster name).
 * - The provisioner function constructs and executes the necessary system command.
 * - The result (success or error) is propagated back up to `main` and the process exits.
 *
 * This structure makes the CLI easy to test and extend with new commands or provisioners
 * without modifying the core dispatch logic in `main.rs`.
