 *
 * This file provides a high-level, asynchronous client for interacting with a HashiCorp
 * Vault instance, specifically tailored for reading secrets from Vault's Key/Value (KV)
 * Version 2 secrets engine. The primary goal of this module is to abstract away the
 * complexities of the Vault API, offering a simple and robust interface for other parts
 * of the application to securely fetch secrets.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The implementation leverages the `rust_vault` crate, which provides a solid foundation
 * for Vault API communication over HTTP. This client is fully asynchronous, built upon
 * `tokio` and `reqwest`, ensuring non-blocking network operations which are critical for
 * performance in I/O-bound tasks.
 *
 * Key components of the architecture:
 * 1. `VaultClient`: A struct that encapsulates the configuration and the underlying
 * `rust_vault` client. It serves as the main entry point for all operations. Its
 * construction is separated from its usage, promoting good configuration management
 * (e.g., loading credentials from environment variables at startup).
 * 2. `VaultConfig`: A simple struct to hold the necessary credentials for connecting
 * to Vaultâ€”namely, the server address and the authentication token. This avoids passing
 * loose strings and creates a clear configuration contract.
 * 3. Asynchronous Operations: All functions that perform network I/O are `async`,
 * allowing them to be integrated seamlessly into a Tokio-based runtime without blocking.
 * 4. Focused Responsibility: This module's sole responsibility is to fetch raw secret
 * data from Vault. It does not concern itself with how these secrets are used, such
 * as injecting them into Kubernetes. This adheres to the single-responsibility principle.
 * 5. Robust Error Handling: All public functions return `anyhow::Result`, which provides
 * rich, contextual error messages. This simplifies error handling for the caller and
 * aids in debugging issues related to network connectivity, authentication, or secret
 * path resolution.
 *
 * Process Flow for fetching a secret:
 * - A `VaultClient` is instantiated once with the required `VaultConfig`.
 * - The `get_secret` method is called with the path to the desired secret in Vault
 * (e.g., "secret/data/my-app/config").
 * - The client communicates with the Vault server via its HTTP API.
 * - It specifically targets the KVv2 engine's data structure, parsing the nested JSON
 * response to extract the `data` map which contains the actual secret key-value pairs.
 * - Upon success, it returns a `HashMap<String, String>` of the secret data.
 * - In case of any failure (e.g., 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden), a descriptive error
 * is returned.
