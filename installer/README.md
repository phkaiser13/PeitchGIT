## What is the Installer Engine?

The `phgit` installer is more than just a script that copies files. It's an intelligent C++ application responsible for the post-installation or standalone setup of the `phgit` toolchain. It is designed to be the smart core inside native packages (like DEB, RPM, MSI) or to be run as a standalone executable, handling tasks that require logic and network access, such as dependency validation and dynamic component downloads.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   üåê **Cross-Platform by Design**: A single C++ codebase with platform-specific modules to handle the nuances of **Windows**, **macOS**, and major **Linux** distribution families (Debian, Fedora, Arch).
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Data-Driven Configuration**: The installer's behavior is defined by `config.json`, not hardcoded. This allows for easy updates to dependencies, API endpoints, and metadata without recompiling the engine.
-   üöÄ **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Automatically detects required tools like Git, Terraform, and Vault. If they are missing or outdated, it can fetch and install them from their official sources.
-   üì° **Live API Integration**: Communicates with external APIs (GitHub Releases, HashiCorp) to fetch the latest versions and checksums for dependencies, ensuring users always get up-to-date and secure components.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Robust and Secure**: Performs SHA256 checksum verification on all downloaded files to ensure integrity and prevent corruption or tampering.
-   üì¶ **Flexible Installation Strategies**: Leverages native package managers (`apt`, `dnf`, `brew`) when available, with a robust fallback to installing from a `.tar.gz` or `.pkg` for maximum compatibility.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Principles

The installer is built on a modular, object-oriented architecture that separates concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.
